    <h1>A DAY IN THE LIFE OF SAHSHA</h1>
      <p>A <em>good</em> day for my pet Sasha begins with a <strong>long walk</strong> along the beach. This is usually accompanied with alot of <strong>running up and down</strong> the strech of white sand. I always have to carry her favourite toy which is a neon coloured freesbie i bought at the pet shop. Long story short, my dog does a good job in helping me get regular excersise. This must definately be the reason why a dog is a <em>man's best friend</em>.</p>

      <p>Because we love fitness, my pet and I would like you to join us next time we hit the beach. Check out <a href="play-date.html">PLAY DATE CALENDER</a> and be sure to book a date.</p>
